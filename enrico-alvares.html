<h1>Enrico Alvares</h1>
<img src="images/enrico.jpg" alt="Enrico Alvares" width="600" style="border-radius:12px;margin-bottom:20px;">
<p class="lede">Violinist, chamber musician, and coach — devoted to helping players develop expressive, intelligent, and communicative ensemble playing.</p>
<p>Enrico began violin studies with his father and went on to attend the Purcell School and the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, where he was profoundly influenced by Hans Keller. He received six years of intensive coaching from all four members of the Amadeus Quartet, an experience that shaped his lifelong understanding of musical structure and interpretation.</p>
<p>He was personally invited by Sir Neville Marriner to join the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, where he performed and recorded worldwide under the direction of Marriner, Iona Brown, and Kenneth Sillito. His work with the Academy — alongside many of the world’s leading soloists and conductors — deeply informed his approach to chamber music and ensemble communication.</p>
<p>In addition to performing, Enrico has received guidance in composition from György Kurtág and Dmitri Smirnov, whose insights continue to shape his entire teaching philosophy. Whilst still a busy performer, he now focuses on coaching chamber ensembles and mentoring violinists and violists — from professional colleagues to very young children — helping players of all backgrounds listen more deeply, think more clearly, and play with renewed imagination.</p>
