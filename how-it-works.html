      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Individuals are matched into groups based on experience, ability, and goals. 
        Repertoire is chosen for a whole term or rotated over the weeks and there is an opportunity for groups to perform to each other at the end of each term. 
      </p>

      <h2>2. Joining or Forming a Group</h2>
      <p>
        Musicians may apply as an existing ensemble or as individual players wishing to be placed in a suitable group.  We ask participants to commit for at least one term, allowing for continuity and steady musical progression.

    <section id="coaching">
      <h2>3. Coaching Sessions</h2>
      <p>
        Coaching takes place in Enrico and Stephanie's home where there are three rehearsal spaces available. Sheet music will be provided although participants are also welcome to bring their own parts.
        
        Sessions always begin with private rehearsal time for each group so that coaching can build on active hands-on music making. Enrico and Stephanie will spend time with every group in rotation. 
        
        There will of course be a break for tea and biscuits!
      </p>
