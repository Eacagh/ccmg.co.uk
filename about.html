<h1>About the Clarendon Chamber Music Group</h1>
<p class="lede">The Clarendon Chamber Music Group was founded by violinists Enrico Alvares and Stephanie Waite to create a welcoming space where adult amateur string players can explore the art of chamber music in depth — supported, inspired, and encouraged.</p>
<p>CCMG grew from a shared belief that playing chamber music is one of the most rewarding ways to develop as a musician — and as a human being. It offers a rare combination of independence and collaboration: every player has a voice, and every rehearsal and performance is a conversation in sound.</p>
<p>Our coaching focuses on listening, communication, and musical imagination. Sessions combine clear technical guidance with open discussion, encouraging players to think and work as a cohesive ensemble while still developing individual expressiveness.</p>
<p>Above all, CCMG aims to make chamber music accessible, fulfilling, and deeply enjoyable for dedicated amateurs at every level. Whether you’re preparing repertoire, forming a new group, or simply looking to rekindle your love of ensemble playing, you’ll find an atmosphere that is relaxed, focused, and genuinely collaborative.</p>
