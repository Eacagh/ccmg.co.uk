<p class="lede">Violinist, chamber musician, and teacher — dedicated to helping players of all ages and abilities build confidence, clarity, and expressive freedom through music-making.</p>
<p>Stephanie studied at the Guildhall School of Music & Drama and has enjoyed a varied career encompassing orchestral, chamber, and educational work. As both performer and teacher, she brings a blend of precision, imagination, and empathy to every musical collaboration.</p>
<p>She has performed with a wide range of professional ensembles and brings this breadth of experience directly into her teaching. Her students — from young beginners to advanced adult players — value her calm, practical approach and her ability to nurture technical security alongside musical understanding.</p>
<p>At the heart of Stephanie’s work lies a belief that learning the violin should be both disciplined and joyful: a means of connecting mind, body, and imagination. Her coaching and teaching reflect this philosophy, creating an environment where players feel supported to listen deeply, think independently, and communicate through sound.</p>
